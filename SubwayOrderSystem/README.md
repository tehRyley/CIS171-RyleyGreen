## Analysis Steps

Build a GUI that incorporates a user choosing
Size of sandwich,
Type of bread,
Type of meat,
Type of cheese,
Up to three veggies,
Type of Sauce, and
Salt & Pepper (Y/N)

### Design

I built the GUI to have many options for a sandwhich going verticly with the ability to scroll. Then creating a second scene to display the chosen options once the user selects the order button.
A back button was also added to the summary page for functionality. A stylesheet was added to customize radio buttons, combo boxes, check boxes, and buttons. the theme was targeted towards subways colors of green and yellow on white.

### Testing

Many tests were made while placeing and adjusting node positions.
the most testing was done whith getting the check boxes to only accept a max of three at a time.
more testing for node placements and second scene creation and display.
finally testing was done while changeing and applying subway themes to some nodes.
