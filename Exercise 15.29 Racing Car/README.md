# GUI Informational Display

A car moving across the screen with speed controls

## Example Output

![Sample Output](README.jpg)

## Analysis Steps

Use the JavaFX API Libraries. Create a car that has controls for pause/play and faster/slower.
You may use image files, if you desire
Experiment with JavaFX - add a skin

### Design

I used a stylesheet to add a background then used two more images, one for the car and another for the sun.

### Testing

I tested each node multiple times while adusting their coordinates
once the still image was in place I tested the animation for motion to the other side of the scene
after the animation was correct I added and tested the required pause/play and speed controls
