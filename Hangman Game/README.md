## Example Output

![Sample Output](README.jpg)

## Analysis Steps

Use the JavaFX API Libraries. Create a display that shows a completed hangman game.

### Design

I used an arc for the base, lines within paths for the hang and body/arms, and finally a circle for the head.

### Testing

With each shape added the program was tested for visibility in the scene.
After each shape was added it was then tested mutliple times while altering the coordinates and other values.
once everything was in place the program was ran once more to test the final shape placements.
