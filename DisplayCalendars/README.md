## Example Output

![Sample Output](README.jpg)

## Analysis Steps

Display a calendar for a specified month and year using Calendar and gregorianCalendar classes. Print the amount of days in the given month of the year after the calendar.

### Design

I used the pre-defined class and methods to display a calendar and grab information on the user inputted month.

### Testing

Firstly testing the current state of the class compared to the request information
by running the code once.

Second add a print line with test text to make sure it's placed under the calendar.

Third fill the print line with required information then run.
