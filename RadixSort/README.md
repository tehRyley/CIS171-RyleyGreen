# Exercise 23.12 Radix Sort

Write a program that randomly generates 1,000,000 integers and sorts them using radix sort.

## Example Output

![Sample Output](README.jpg)

## Analysis Steps

Using radix sorting on 1,000,000 random integers

### Design

I used seperate methods to generate and then sort the integers.

### Testing

A test was done by generrating 50 random integers.
then increasing to 1,000,000 random integers and printing the array out before sorting.
the final test was done by running the generated numbers through the radix sort and displaying the array after sorting.
