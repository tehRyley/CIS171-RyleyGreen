# Exercise 16.6 Demonstrate Text field properties

Write a program that sets the horizontal-alignment and column-size properties of a text field dynamically.

## Example Output

![Sample Output](README.jpg)

## Analysis Steps

Follow the steps needed to create a text field with options to change column size and alignment dynamically.

### Design

a text field of testing that allows a user to input text.
radio buttons to allow the user to dynamically change the chosen text's alignment (Left, Center, and Right.)
and an Additional text field will allow the user to change the initial testing text field's column size through the input of integers.

### Testing

After the inital layout was complete a test run was used to make sure everything was in the correct place.
The radio buttons were then added to a group and tested for interaction.
another test was done after the radio buttons and column size text field were both given functionality.
The final test was done after adjustiing the scene size a bit and everything was working.
