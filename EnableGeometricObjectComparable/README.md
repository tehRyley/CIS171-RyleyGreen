# EnableGeometricObjectComparable

Allows user to create circles and rectangles of different sizes, then compare them to each other to determine the largest object.

## Example Output

![Sample Output](README.jpg)

## Analysis Steps

Modify the GeometricObject class to include the comparable interface allowing for the comparison between object sizes.

### Design

I used the included classes and methods for the creation of objects, with modification to compare sizes. An additional class was created for testing purposes.

### Testing

Firstly I tested the interaction between the GeometricObject and Circle/Rectangle classes for object creation. 

Secondly a placeholder for the compareTo method executed a similar task

Last the placeholder was further developed into the compareTo method and tested for each common result.
